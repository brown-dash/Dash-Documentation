# Ink

Dash allow the user to draw various shapes and lines, each represented by an ink stroke. Each ink stroke is a document. Ink documents can be created using a simple pen tool or a polygon tool. Currently implemented polygons include: circles, rectangles, straight lines, and arrows. Once an ink document is created, its properties, such as stroke color, fill color, stroke width, and control points can further be modified under the Properties Panel.

## Creating Ink 

The ink tools can be found in the ink toolbar. Single-clicking on one of the tools will bring the user to ink mode only for the duration of that drawing action. Conversely, double-clicking will keep the user in ink mode until the button is clicked again.
