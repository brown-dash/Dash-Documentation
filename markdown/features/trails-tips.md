# Presentation Trails | Tips and Tricks

## Pinning

In Dash, we use the term `pin` to refer to **adding** any node, or view of that node, to a presentation trail. GIFs showing how nodes are pinned to the trail are included below.

### Text

**Pin with Pin Button**
1. Select the text node you would like to add.
2. Hit the pin icon on the document decoration menu.
3. Notice that the document is added to the currently active trail, in this case `Demo Trail` which is already open. 
4. Clicking on the trail will `pan` and `zoom` to the relevant part of the trail.

**Pin with Drag**
1. Drag the document into an empty space on the trail. You can *either* use the title bar to drag it, or drag on the document itself.

**Pin with View**
1. To `Pin with View` you select the document to bring up the document decorations. 
2. Hold down `Shift` and click on the `Pin` icon
3. You know if a document is pinned with view, if it has the `V` button appear on the slide. 

The notion of `Pin with View` for any document is that it will pin the document with the current view properties that the document currently has. These properties include:
1. `scroll`: The scroll location of the document. 
2. `x` and `y`: The x-coordinate on the 2D canvas.

If you click on the `Update View` button on the slide in the presentation trail it will update to whatever the current view specs of that document are. You can use this feature to animate movement.
