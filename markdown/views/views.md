# Views

Views are the different ways that you can view a collection of documents. Dash supports three views in `novice mode`, and an additional 10 in `developer mode`. The most essential views that dash supports include:

| View     | Description                                                                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Freeform | Unbounded 2D space in the form of a canvas. This is Dashâ€™s primary view                           |
| Schema   | Manipulating documents via key-value pairs and maintaining structured viewing and sorting of data |
| Stack    | Categorizing documents by specified keys while maintaining a live preview of each document        |

## Changing Views

Use the dropdown in the top toolbar to change between views. If you don't see the dropdown or see a document-specific toolbar like image or text, click a blank area of the main view to invoke the view dropdown.
