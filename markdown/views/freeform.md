## Description: 
Unbounded 2D space in the form of a canvas. This is Dash's primary view

## Good for: 
User-driven spatial organization and layout of documents
Visualizing document relationships, e.g., neighborhoods/clusters of related materials, nesting, and linking
Gaining “raw” views of documents to get a sense of their individual layouts
