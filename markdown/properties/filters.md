## Description 
Filtering allows you to narrow your view of documents based on metadata fields.

## How to Create a Filter:
You begin by selecting the dropdown menu and which metadata fields you want to filter. After selecting a field, the filter options for that metadata will appear with checkboxes below the dropdown menu. 

By clicking the checkbox, the documents on the canvas will remain if they are included in that category. If the document is not included, you will only be able to view the document after removing the filter. 

There are two buttons on the right-hand side of the metadata header: a square allowing you to collapse the options within the metadata header and a circle to remove the filter. 

**Collapse**: This will hide the filtering options for the specific metadata header. If you are currently filtering on any of these options, the filter will remain and be displayed in bold below the header.
**Remove**: This will stop showing the metadata filter below the dropdown menu. If any filters from this metadata are currently selected, they will be removed.
