## Description: 
Options displays buttons that adjust the view and characteristics of the currently selected document or perspective. The number of options depends on the type of document or perspective you have currently selected and your current mode (novice or developer).

### Title:
This button allows you to view the title of the selected document or dashboard. You can edit the title by selecting the document and the text area above the document, or you can click on the editable Title box in the Properties Menu.

`SHOW TITLE` - The title will appear at the top of the selected item. <br>
`HOVER TITLE`- The title of the document will only appear once you hover over anywhere on the selected document. <br>
`HIDE TITLE` - The title of the document will not appear, but the title name will not be lost. <br>

### Caption:
This button displays the currently selected document’s caption. A user adds the caption to give more context to the current document. You can view the caption by hovering over the document.

`SHOW CAPTION` - Allows you to edit and view the caption upon hovering over the bottom of the document. <br> 
`HIDE CAPTION` - Hides the caption from the user. Caption contents will not be lost. <br>

### Lock:
This button enables a document to remain in place upon hovering over the document and attempting to move it around the freeform canvas.

`LOCK` – Allows a document to remain in place when you hover over it and try to move the document around the canvas. Once you double-click on the document and have it selected, you can move the document around the canvas. In order to move the document, you must hover and click the editable text space above the document. <br>
`UNLOCK` – Allows a document to be moved around the freeform canvas upon hovering over the document. <br>

### Fit Width: 
This button determines if the currently selected document will fit the entire screen. This button is particularly useful when viewing documents at their natural size from Notetaking and Stacking perspectives. 

`RESTRICT WIDTH` – The currently selected document will take its natural size and leave extra space around the edges. <br>
`FIT WIDTH` –The currently selected document’s dimension will cover the entire width of the given space. <br>

### Active:
This button allows you to toggle the functionality of the mouse when hovering over a document. 

`ACTIVE INTERACTION` – Allows you to interact with the contents of a document when hovering over the document. With this button, you will not have to click on the document to interact with the contents. <br>
`INACTIVE INTERACTION` – Ensures you click on the document before interacting with the contents of a document. Upon hovering over the document, you can drag the document around the canvas. <br>

### View All: 
This button allows you to toggle between viewing all documents on the canvas at once and your previous view of the documents. 

`VIEW ALL` – Allows you to view all documents on the canvas at one time. Upon selection, you will not be able to move around the canvas. <br>
`PREVIOUS VIEW` –  Takes you back to your previous view of the documents in the canvas. <br>


### Grid: 
This button allows you to view or hide the grid in the freeform canvas view. 

`HIDE GRID` – Removes the grid from the Canvas View. <br>
`VIEW GRID` – Creates a grid in the Canvas View. <br>

### Snap Lines:
This button allows you to view Snap Lines. These lines help you locate dimensions and align the selected document with others. We recommend hiding the grid view to understand the given Snap Lines better.

`SHOW SNAP LINES` – Allows you to view Snap Lines to guide alignment between documents. <br>
`HIDE SNAP LINES` – Removes snap lines from the Canvas View. <br>

### Clusters: 
This button gives a background highlight to a document depending on its proximity to other documents. 

`HIGHLIGHT CLUSTERS` – Displays a highlighted background for documents. The color of the highlight depends on the proximity to other documents. This color will change if the document is moved around the canvas. <br>
`DISABLE CLUSTERS` – Removes background highlights of a document. <br>

### Panning: 
This button affects the ability to pan around the Freeform canvas. 

`DISABLE PANNING` – Disables you from moving around the Freeform Canvas. <br>

`PLAIN INK` – Displays the ink stroke as previously created in the Freeform Canvas. <br>

### Background image: 
This button hides an image. The document will remain on the Canvas.
