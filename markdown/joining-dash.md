## Role Overview

Dash is an ideal project if you'd like to get hands-on experience developing a web application built in the MERN stack with the goal of creating a tool that can support research work, notetaking, and ideas for what research will look like in the future. Dash is packaged to look initially like an ordinary whiteboard with one or more, potentially nested, unbounded 2D workspaces where users can simply post relevant documents - PDF files, videos, text notes, etc. - and informally explore and organize them. However, Dash goes beyond simple surface layout to capture much richer relationships which users can then explore and transform with powerful database and programming-oriented tools.

## Expected contribution

The expected hours for this position are approximately that of a CS systems class (12-15 hours per week). We hold biweekly in-person 2-hour sprints and have a weekly hour-long project meeting.

## Contact

Please reach out to Andries van Dam (andries_van_dam@brown.edu), Bob Zeleznik (zzzman@gmail.com), or Geireann (geireann@brown.edu) with additional questions.

We look forward to meeting you!

## Join our QA Team!

Interested in Dash and want to get involved without the commitment of being on the project team? Dash is currently looking for QA testers to help us identify usability issues and bugs. This is a flexible opportunity, as we appreciate as much or as little time as you are able to give. If you'd like to learn more about Dash's features and help make it better, fill out the form linked below and we will be in touch with you!
