# Joining Dash

Dash is currently recruiting new project members! Please see below for application details

## Role Overview

Dash is an ideal project if you'd like to get hands-on experience developing a web application built in the MERN stack with the goal of creating a tool that can support research work, notetaking, and ideas for what research will look like in the future. Dash is packaged to look initially like an ordinary whiteboard with one or more, potentially nested, unbounded 2D workspaces where users can simply post relevant documents - PDF files, videos, text notes, etc. - and informally explore and organize them. However, Dash goes beyond simple surface layout to capture much richer relationships which users can then explore and transform with powerful database and programming-oriented tools.

## Expected Contribution

The expected hours for this position are approximately 10-15 hours per week. We hold biweekly in-person 2-hour sprints and have a weekly hour-long project meeting.
