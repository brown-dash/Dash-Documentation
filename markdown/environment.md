### What is a Dashboard?
A particular layout of tiles is called a dashboard, and consists of one or more tiles. A user can have multiple dashboards to support different workflows. For example, one to collect a photo album, and another to take notes during class. Although documents can be linked and moved between dashboards, they are primarily designed to operate seperately.
