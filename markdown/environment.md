When you first open Dash, you will see a home menu for managing your dashboards. From here you can view, delete, and share your dashboards or view dashboards shared with you by others in the "Shared Dashboards" menu. Selecting the "New Dashboard+" button or the empty dashboard with the + will create a new empty dashboard.

</div>

The first view in a new dashboard is an empty pannable freeform canvas, one of many views that Dash supports. The freeform view is a pannable and zoomable freeform unbounded 2D canvas where the majority of Dash's workflow takes place. It is surround by toolbars and panels which we will go over below.

#### Dashboards
A flyout panel that contains a list of the user’s active dashboards and documents. The user can right-click on the topmost “Dashboard” to invoke the right-click menu, then selecting “Create Dashboard”, in order to create a new dashboard. Each dashboard contains the collections that are within that workspace and the user can choose to expand those collections to view a list of all the items in that collection. The “On-screen Tab” section contains all your currently-opened tabs. Tabs you have closed will be moved to the “Off-screen Tab” section.

## Dashboards, Tiles & Tabs

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LDsG36vURzBNGueNkX7xZVpY4Wflf5v/preview" width="640" height="400" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

### What is a Dashboard?

A particular layout of tabs is called a dashboard. A dashboard can consist of one or more tabs. A user can have multiple dashboards to support different workflows. For example, one to collect a photo album, and another to take notes during class. Although documents can be linked and moved between dashboards, they are primarily designed to operate seperately. When you first log into Dash you will be placed in Dashboard 1 which is clearly in the topbar.

#### Modifying Dashboards

The home menu allows you to view and manage your dashboards. From here you can create new dashboards as well as rename or share existing ones by right clicking on them.

</div>

### What is a tab?

We display dash documents in the window manager with tabs. A tab can contain any document in dash. In your dashboard, tabs are organised into `Off-screen tabs` and `On-screen tabs`.

### What is a tile?

Tiles can contain multiple tabs, you can drag and drop a tab into a tile such that you have multiple tabs in the same way that a browser like Chrome has multiple tabs.
