When you first open Dash, you will see a home menu for managing your dashboards. From here you can view, delete, and share your dashboards or view dashboards shared with you by others in the "Shared Dashboards" menu. Selecting the "New Dashboard+" button or the empty dashboard with the + will create a new empty dashboard.

</div>

The first view in a new dashboard is an empty pannable freeform canvas, one of many views that Dash supports. The freeform view is a pannable and zoomable freeform unbounded 2D canvas where the majority of Dash's workflow takes place. It is surround by toolbars and panels which we will go over below.

## Dashboards, Tiles & Tabs

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LDsG36vURzBNGueNkX7xZVpY4Wflf5v/preview" width="640" height="400" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

### What is a Dashboard?

A particular layout of tabs is called a dashboard. A dashboard can consist of one or more tabs. A user can have multiple dashboards to support different workflows. For example, one to collect a photo album, and another to take notes during class. Although documents can be linked and moved between dashboards, they are primarily designed to operate seperately.

#### Managing Dashboards

The home menu allows you to view and manage your dashboards. From here you can create new dashboards, share existing ones, and delete dashboards.

<!-- <div class="img-container">
  <img src="../assets/gifs/environment/new-dashboard.gif" alt="new dashboard" style="height:300px;"/>
</div> -->

### What is a tab?

We display dash documents in the window manager with tabs. This is similar to a browser tab. A tab can contain any document in dash.

#### Creating/Deleting Tabs

You can create a tab by clicking on the plus at the top right of a tile. You can delete a tab by clicking on the x icon of each tab.

![](../assets/gifs/environment/dash-create-delete-tab.gif){:.img}

To open a document in a new tab, drag the document title bar to the tabs manager, and release.

From there, if you click on the tab manager region, you'll create a new tab in the current [tile](environment.md#what-is-a-tile).

![](../assets/gifs/environment/dash-drag-tab.gif){:.img}

If you want to place the new document tab in a new [tile](environment.md#what-is-a-tile), rather than clicking on the tabs manager, you can instead drag the document to the region of the freeform where you want to create a new tile.

![](../assets/gifs/environment/dash-drag-tab-tile.gif){:.img}

To drag a document tab back into another tab, drag the document icon on the tab header back into the main tab.

![](../assets/gifs/environment/dash-drag-tab-back.gif){:.img}

### What is a tile?

Tiles can contain multiple tabs, you can drag and drop a tab into a tile such that you have multiple tabs in the same way that a browser like Chrome has multiple tabs.

#### Creating a Tile

To create a new tile with tabs, drag the header of an existing tab to the section of the freeform where you want to create a new tile.

![](../assets/gifs/environment/dash-drag-tab-create-tile.gif){:.img}

#### Closing a Tab

To close a tab, click the x icon at the top-right of a tile.
