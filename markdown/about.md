# About Dash

**Dash** provides an integrated environment for document-based knowledge work, enhanced with pen- and touch interactions. Knowledge workers consume, annotate, and produce digital documents such as PDF files, videos, images, and text notes to form mental models, gain understanding, and create new documents. While many software solutions and utilities exist that assist users in stages of this process, they exist as "application silos" where they cannot easily be adjusted or transformed to interoperate with each other. Furthermore, while the Microsoft Office and the Google G suite are commonly used, other useful tools such as FileMaker or Tinderbox are much less well known and consequently underutilized by knowledge workers engaged in document-centric activities.

In contrast, integrated development environments for programmers provide a suite of extensible tools that are designed to interoperate with each other and empower programmers to work more efficiently and gain better insights over their work. No modern software engineer would choose to work without an IDE. We are thus motivated by the research question of whether we can provide a similar experience for knowledge workers who typically have no programming background and who also commonly work with document-oriented data that is not formally structured. Dash supports document-centric knowledge work as a whole by allowing users to create, collect, and relate heterogeneous documents in both structured and free-form workspaces.

Dash is packaged to look initially like an ordinary whiteboard with one or more, potentially nested, unbounded 2D workspaces where users can simply post relevant documents - PDF files, videos, text notes, etc. - and informally explore and organize them. However, Dash goes beyond simple surface layout to capture much richer relationships which users can then explore and transform with powerful database and programming-oriented tools. By uniformly representing all documents and metadata as dynamically extensible programming objects, Dash assists users in evolving from being mere document viewers who only instantiate documents, to data-smiths who create structured relationships between documents, to full tool-smiths who can create customized operations that can capture more complex workflows. This process is analogous to a spreadsheet user who moves from entering data, to modifying cell formulas, to eventually creating customized data models.
