## Description
Basic physics simulation platform with three modes: Freeform Mode, Tutorial Mode, and Review Mode.
- In Freeform Mode, users can set up basic simulations that are animated physically correctly. 
- In Tutorial Mode, users can go through step-by-step tutorials explaining how to solve particular mechanics problems for different simulations. 
- In Review Mode, users can solve example mechanics problem and animate simulations based on their answers to questions. 

## Simulation Types
- Projectiles
- Inclined planes
- Pendulums
- Springs
- Pulleys
- Weights suspended from two rods
- Weights undergoing circular motion 

## Access 
Pull up the colon menu, and select simulation. The dropdown menus in the upper right corner of the simulation document can be used to change the simulation mode and type.
