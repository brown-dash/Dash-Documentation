## Linked Text Notes

- Selecting a pin will filter the notes to those linked to the selected pin
- Deselecting a pin will reveal all notes made on that map

## More with linking
- You can link a document to the map or add the map to a trail and preserve the map's contents (location, zoom, map view type)
- If a pin is selected when the link was made, following the link will bring you to the map centered on the (highlighted) link
- If a pin is not selected when the link was made, following the link will bring you to the same location as when the link was made

With this functionality, we can create some pretty cool results:
