    "content": "# About Dash **Dash** provides an integrated environment for document-based knowledge work, enhanced with pen- and touch interactions. Knowledge workers consume, annotate, and produce digital documents such as PDF files, videos, images, and text notes to form mental models, gain understanding, and create new documents. While many software solutions and utilities exist that assist users in stages of this process, they exist as \"application silos\" where they cannot easily be adjusted or transformed to interoperate with each other. Furthermore, while the Microsoft Office and the Google G suite are commonly used, other useful tools such as FileMaker or Tinderbox are much less well known and consequently underutilized by knowledge workers engaged in document-centric activities. In contrast, integrated development environments for programmers provide a suite of extensible tools that are designed to interoperate with each other and empower programmers to work more efficiently and gain better insights over their work. No modern software engineer would choose to work without an IDE. We are thus motivated by the research question of whether we can provide a similar experience for knowledge workers who typically have no programming background and who also commonly work with document-oriented data that is not formally structured. Dash supports document-centric knowledge work as a whole by allowing users to create, collect, and relate heterogeneous documents in both structured and free-form workspaces. Dash is packaged to look initially like an ordinary whiteboard with one or more, potentially nested, unbounded 2D workspaces where users can simply post relevant documents - PDF files, videos, text notes, etc. - and informally explore and organize them. However, Dash goes beyond simple surface layout to capture much richer relationships which users can then explore and transform with powerful database and programming-oriented tools. By uniformly representing all documents and metadata as dynamically extensible programming objects, Dash assists users in evolving from being mere document viewers who only instantiate documents, to data-smiths who create structured relationships between documents, to full tool-smiths who can create customized operations that can capture more complex workflows. This process is analogous to a spreadsheet user who moves from entering data, to modifying cell formulas, to eventually creating customized data models. ",

    "content": "# Audio {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} The audio document allows the user to record and play back audio or play back imported audio files. ## Creating Audio Documents To create an audio document, navigate to the Tools Menu and drag off an audio button onto your collection. You can also create an audio document by navigating to the Import Menu and importing an audio file from outside of Dash or by dragging and dropping a file in from an external source. ## Actions ### Pre-Recording - **Record:** Pressing the black record button on a new empty audio document begins a recording - **Dictation:** Selecting the grey transcript button before beginning the recording creates a text document that transcribes what you say after you begin recording. ### During Recording - **Pause/Play:** This button pauses and resumes the recording. - **Stop:** This button stops the recording. - **Dictation:** Transcription can also be started during the recording by selecting the button and then left clicking the generated text document. This creates a timecode in the document of the time ### Post-Recording - **Pause/Play:** This button pauses or plays the audio document from the current time indicated by the red line on the timeline and the timestamp in the bottom left corner. - **Trimming:** Clicking the scissor icon displays the trim controls. Dragging either of the handles at the end of the timeline will change the range the clip is being trimmed to. Selecting the check icon will finish the trim and display the new altered clip. Trimming is not destructive so a shortened clip can always be lengthened again up to its original duration. Markers that are cut off by trimming a clip will be cut down to the portion that remains in the range of the new clip. If a marker is entirely out of range it will no longer play. Lengthening the clip again will increase the marker up to its initial length. - **Region Markers:** To create a region marker, click on the desired starting time on the timeline and drag until the desired ending time. The region marker will play audio from the the marker's start to end. - **Label Markers:** To create a label marker, shift-click the desired time on the timeline. The label marker will playback audio from the start time of the marker to the end of the entire audio clip. Both types of markers can be deleted by right clicking on them to display the context menu and then selecting delete. ## Right-Click Menu The following audio-specific items can be found in the right-click menu for an audio document: - **Play/Don't play when link is selected:** Toggle this option to play/don’t play the audio at the linked time when a link has been selected - **Hide/Don't hide ranged markers:** Toggle this option to hide/not hide the ranged markers - **Hide/Don't hide label markers:** Toggle this option to hide/not hide the label markers - **Play/Don't play markers on click:** Toggle this option to play/not play the ranged/labels markers when they are selected ## Link Audio Documents While recording, if the user creates any text documents, it will automatically be linked to the audio document at the creation time. While recording, the user can generate timestamps for the text document by pressing enter or pausing for 10 seconds (this can be toggled in the text document’s context menu). Linking to the audio document will generate a link at the current time. Linking to range/label markers will generate a link corresponding to their start/end time. ",

    "content": "# Ink {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} Dash allows the user to draw various shapes and lines, each represented by an ink stroke. Each ink stroke is a document. Ink documents can be created using a simple pen tool or a polygon tool. Currently implemented polygons include: circles, rectangles, straight lines, and arrows. Once an ink document is created, its properties, such as stroke color, fill color, stroke width, and control points can further be modified under the Properties Panel. ## Creating Ink The ink tools can be found in the ink toolbar. Single-clicking on one of the tools will bring the user to ink mode only for the duration of that drawing action. Conversely, double-clicking will keep the user in ink mode until the button is clicked again. ## Formatting Ink When the user opens the Properties Panel while at least one ink document is selected, the \"appearance\" and \"transform\" subpanels become visible. Changes made in the panels will only be reflected in the documents selected. ### Appearance Panel - **Change Width:** Users can augment width using the input box or the range slider. - **Arrow Head/End:** Users can add or remove arrowheads or arrow ends by checking the corresponding box. - **Dashed Line:** Users can toggle between solid and dashed strokes by checking the corresponding box. - **Fill and Stroke Color:** Users can change the colors of the stroke and fill using the palette that appears when the user clicks on the currently selected colors. ### Transform Panel - **Editing Points:** Clicking on the \"edit points\" button in the transform subpanel or double-clicking the currently selected ink brings up multiple squares outlined in blue along the ink stroke. By dragging these control points and tangent handles, users can alter the Bézier curve. When one handle point is moved, its opposite handle point will rotate the same angle in the opposite direction, resulting in synchronous movement. To break handle tangency and allow independent movement of either handle point, the user can hold the 'Alt' or 'Option' key while dragging. Double-tapping a broken control point will snap the handles back to being parallel and re-enable synchronous movement. Control points can be deleted (pressing backspace with the point selected) or added (single clicking on the desired point on the stroke, indicated by the blue circle that appears on hover). - **Lock Ratio:** Users can click on the lock button to lock the dimension ratio so that they can change the width and the height of the document proportionally. - **Rotate:** Users can rotate ink documents 90 degrees by clicking on the rotate button. Alternatively, users can change the value inside the “∠:” input box. - **Height and Width:** Users can change the height and width of the ink documents by changing the values inside the “H:” and “W:” input boxes. - **X and Y:** Users can change the x coordinate and y coordinate of the ink documents by changing the values inside the “X:” and “Y:” input boxes.

    "doc": "Linking",
    "title": "Linking",
    "content": "# Linking {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} A link in Dash can be thought of as a bidirectional connection between two documents, or a reference to one document from another. It is also a document in itself, meaning that we can add tags and other key/value pairs. The same source selection (called an anchor, i.e., a persistent selection) can link to multiple destination anchors. In addition, source and destination anchors can both range from the entire document to a portion of a document (i.e., a phrase within a long text document, an annotation on a pdf, a selection on an image, etc). We now describe two different mechanisms for creating links; we begin by describing document to document links. More information on linking between selections within documents can be found here. ## Creating Links - \"Drag and Drop\" Method There are two methods of creating links. The first is “drag-and-drop”, which is a light-weight method good for creating a one-to-one link between documents that both appear on the screen at a given time, whether in the same tab or in two different tiles. 1. Select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar where three icons are present. 2. Click and drag the leftmost link icon (the “make link” button), then drop it onto the desired destination document. 3. After the link is created, two messages will appear on the screen: - The upper message notifies that a link was successfully created, and will disappear after two seconds. - The lower message displays an input box to enter an optional label for the link - it typically is an explanatory word or short phrase describing the link. Pressing enter on the keyboard or clicking the add button will add the label to the link, and clicking anywhere else outside of the message or clicking the dismiss button will cause the message to disappear. - If users do not enter a link label on creation or wish to modify the label after creation, it can be done through the link menu (described in the subsequent editing links section). - Once a link is created, if there are no existing links on the document a blue dot will appear on the bottom left corner of the document containing the number of links that exist on the document. This counter is incremented for each additional link created. More information on this dot and its functionality can be found here. ## Creating Links - \"Linkboard\" The second method for link creation is through the “linkboard,” which is convenient for creating many links with the same source and for creating links while maintaining another workflow. This functions as a clipboard (similar to copy and paste) for links in the sense that your source is always “copied” to the linkboard until you clear it or “copy” another source. 1. Same as the first method above, select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar where three icons are present. 2. Then, left-click on the make link button. This turns the document into a source document for links to be created from. The make link button will turn grey with a red outline, and the middle icon (the “end link” button) will be activated, indicated by a black background. 3. In addition, a popup bar will appear at the bottom of the screen, next to the shortcut buttons. This popup displays the current source document’s title and allows users to change certain linking preferences using the two grey buttons: 4. Complete the link by clicking on the complete link button in the bottom toolbar of the desired target document. Clicking this complete link button on any document that is not the source document will create a link between the source document and that document. Clicking on the complete link button on the source document will do nothing. 5. At any time (whether there is a source on the linkboard or not), clicking the start link button (the first button in the bottom buttons of the document) will make that document the source for links. If there was already a source on the linkboard, that source will be cleared and the selected document will become the new source. When there is a source on the link board, the user can go about their workflow normally. They can continue to select and interact with documents as they normally would and view and edit existing links as well. The only difference is that when there is a source on the link board, the stop link button is active and the user can no longer make “drag and drop” links from the source (because clicking that button again will clear the source), however the user can still make “drag and drop” links from any other document. ## Editing Links: - Once links are created on a document, a blue link dot appears in its bottom left corner containing the counter that shows the number of links on the document: - Clicking on the blue link dot will open a link menu that displays each link on the document in a list. Each link is shown with an icon representing the type of document that the link is to and the title of the document that is on the other end of the link: - Hovering over an item in this link menu displays several options for the link. First, hovering over the title produces a blue underline which indicates that the title is a hyperlink that can be clicked on to follow the link (more information here). Hovering over the title also shows a preview of the destination document: - Hovering over an item in the link menu also makes three buttons on that link visible: - The leftmost button is to toggle on/off the link as a dotted curved path between the two documents (link path). - Clicking on the rightmost button deletes the link. Deleting a link deletes it on both the source and destination documents. If a document contains only one link, and that link is deleted, the blue link dot at the bottom left corner will disappear, and will only reappear when another new link is created on that document. - The middle button is to edit the link’s properties. Clicking on the button to edit the link will invoke a link editor: - In this link editor, the user can edit the link label that they added on creation of the link (or add a link label if they chose to not add one). The label will be added to the link when the user clicks the set button or hits enter after typing in the label box. When the label is added, the set button will turn green for 2 seconds to indicate to the user that the label was added. When a link label has been added, it will be shown in the link menu, right underneath the title of the destination document: - The user can also set a link relationship or choose one of their existing link relationships. All the links in the same relationship have the same link path color. Link paths have weights corresponding to their relative importance (i.e. number of links contained in the relationship) - The user can also choose to modify the follow behavior of the link (a type of “view spec”). Following a link takes the user to the destination document. The link editor allows the user to select different follow behaviors from this dropdown menu: - The default option is to pan the screen to the destination document if both documents are in the same collection and otherwise opens it in a new tile on the right side of the screen. - Additionally, the user can click the arrow in the top right corner of the editor to display/hide more information about the link ## Additional Link Functionalities - **Linking selections within a document:** For text, pdf, webpage (linking with Hypothes.is), image, audio (linking with audio) documents, the user has the option to link a specific selection within a document (anchor) to another document: - **Text** In order to link a piece of text in a document, the user must select the text and then drag the link icon to the document that they want to link it to (shown below). As of 8/10/2020, the “linkboard” method (clicking the start link and complete link buttons) is not yet supported and using this method will link your entire text document to the destination. Once the text anchor is linked, it turns blue and will show a blue underline on hover. The user can click on the linked piece of text to preview the destination document and use the two buttons at the top right corner to delete and follow the link. (*external hyperlinks to websites outside of Dash will always show a blue underline so that they can be differentiated from internal links within Dash) - **Image/PDF/Web** In order to link a portion of an image, PDF, or webpage, the user must first create a selection on the document. This can be done by right clicking and dragging over the area that the user wants to select. Once the user has made this selection, they can treat the selection as a document and use its bottom buttons to create links normally (not shown in gif). - **Following Links:** In order to follow a link on a document, you must click on the title of the destination document in the link menu. Clicking on this and “following” the link will show you the destination document of this link, based on the specified following behavior (following behavior). - **Showing Links and Labels:** In the link menu, there is an option to visibly show the link. Clicking on this option will show a dotted path between the two documents that are linked. If there is a link label on this link, it will appear on the dotted path. The user can also move the link label around this path and position it where they want. ",

With presentation trails you can easily go from authoring mode, to presentation mode - and turn whatever you are working on into a smooth presentation. Presentation Trails work best when all of the documents are contained within Freeform collections, as it makes use of pan and zoom to navigate between documents. ## Creating a Presentation Trail There are three ways of bring up a new Presentation Trail document, they are as follows: - **Tools menu:** Presentation trail button which can be opened on the right hand side of your workspace on click. - **Pin any document to presentation:** To pin or any document from the active Presentation Trail use the document decorations ‘Pin to Presentation’ button. If the Presentation Trail is not already open, pinning a document will open the Presentation - Trail document on the right hand side of your workspace. - **Pres. Trails Sidebar**: Right click anywhere on the presentation trails sidebar menu, and select the option to “Create New Presentation” To access a Presentation Trail that has already been created use the PRES. TRAILS sidebar in the left hand toolbar, or use Search. ## Objects & Actions ### Adding documents to a presntation trail #### Regular pin: To pin any document to the presentation trail simply select a document and use the ‘Pin’ button in the document decorations to add it to the presentation trail. If the user has not yet created a presentation trail, then this button will also create a new presentation trail and add that specific document as the first slide in the trail. #### Pin with view: Pinning with view pins the document with the specific pan and zoom that you have currently set it to. The ‘Pin with View’ icon is the same as the regular pin icon, but the “V” behind the pin shows that it is a view. You can pin with view in two ways: - Chroma - Pin with current view - Marquee menu - pin with selection drag ### Slides #### Slide Properties ##### Transitions ###### Movement ###### Visibility & Duration ### Modes ",
