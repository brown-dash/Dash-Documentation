    "content": "# About Dash **Dash** provides an integrated environment for document-based knowledge work, enhanced with pen- and touch interactions. Knowledge workers consume, annotate, and produce digital documents such as PDF files, videos, images, and text notes to form mental models, gain understanding, and create new documents. While many software solutions and utilities exist that assist users in stages of this process, they exist as \"application silos\" where they cannot easily be adjusted or transformed to interoperate with each other. Furthermore, while the Microsoft Office and the Google G suite are commonly used, other useful tools such as FileMaker or Tinderbox are much less well known and consequently underutilized by knowledge workers engaged in document-centric activities. In contrast, integrated development environments for programmers provide a suite of extensible tools that are designed to interoperate with each other and empower programmers to work more efficiently and gain better insights over their work. No modern software engineer would choose to work without an IDE. We are thus motivated by the research question of whether we can provide a similar experience for knowledge workers who typically have no programming background and who also commonly work with document-oriented data that is not formally structured. Dash supports document-centric knowledge work as a whole by allowing users to create, collect, and relate heterogeneous documents in both structured and free-form workspaces. Dash is packaged to look initially like an ordinary whiteboard with one or more, potentially nested, unbounded 2D workspaces where users can simply post relevant documents - PDF files, videos, text notes, etc. - and informally explore and organize them. However, Dash goes beyond simple surface layout to capture much richer relationships which users can then explore and transform with powerful database and programming-oriented tools. By uniformly representing all documents and metadata as dynamically extensible programming objects, Dash assists users in evolving from being mere document viewers who only instantiate documents, to data-smiths who create structured relationships between documents, to full tool-smiths who can create customized operations that can capture more complex workflows. This process is analogous to a spreadsheet user who moves from entering data, to modifying cell formulas, to eventually creating customized data models. ",

    "content": "# Audio {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} The audio document allows the user to record and play back audio or play back imported audio files. ## Creating Audio Documents Audio documents can be created by: 1. Using the colon menu 2. Importing an audio file from outside of Dash using the Import Menu 3. Dragging and dropping a file in from outside of Dash ## Actions ### Pre-Recording - **Record:** Pressing the black record button on a new empty audio document begins a recording - **Dictation:** Selecting the grey transcript button before beginning the recording creates a text document that transcribes what you say after you begin recording. ![](../../../assets/gifs/audio/audiocreaterecord.gif){:.img} ### During Recording - **Pause/Play:** This button pauses and resumes the recording. - **Stop:** This button stops the recording. - **Dictation:** Transcription can also be started during the recording by selecting the button and then left clicking the generated text document. This creates a linked timecode in the document of the time you begin talking. - **Linking:** Documents that are created while recording will be automatically linked to the audio recording and will have a linked label marker displayed on the timeline at the point where the document was created. ![](../../../assets/gifs/audio/dictation.gif){:.img} ### Post-Recording - **Pause/Play:** This button pauses or plays the audio document from the current time indicated by the red line on the timeline and the timestamp in the bottom left corner. - **Trimming:** Clicking the scissor icon displays the trim controls. Dragging either of the handles at the end of the timeline will change the range the clip is being trimmed to. Double clicking either handle will reset it to the start or end of the clip. Pressing the play button while trimming will preview the trimmed range. Selecting the check icon will finish the trim and display the new altered clip. Trimming is not destructive so a shortened clip can always be lengthened again up to its original duration. Markers that are cut off by trimming a clip will be cut down to the portion that remains in the range of the new clip. If a marker is entirely out of range it will no longer play. Lengthening the clip again will increase the marker up to its initial length. ![](../../../assets/gifs/audio/audiotrimming.gif){:.img} - **Region Markers:** To create a region marker, click on the desired starting time on the timeline and drag until the desired ending time. The region marker will play audio from the the marker's start to end. Clicking on a region marker reveals handles on both sides that allow the user to change the marker's range. - **Label Markers:** To create a label marker, shift-click the desired time on the timeline. The label marker will playback audio from the start time of the marker to the end of the entire audio clip. Both types of markers can be deleted by right clicking on them to display the context menu and then selecting delete. ## Right-Click Menu The following audio-specific items can be found in the right-click menu for an audio document: - **Hide Anchors:** This will show/hide all range and label markers from the timeline - **Don't play when link is selected:** Toggles the ability for markers to play automatically when one of their links is selected - **Auto play anchors onClick:** Toggles the ability for markers to play automatically when they are clicked ![](../../../assets/gifs/audio/audiohideanchors.gif){:.img} ## Link Audio Documents While recording, if the user creates any text documents, it will automatically be linked to the audio document at the creation time. While recording, the user can generate timestamps for the text document by pressing enter or pausing for 10 seconds (this can be toggled in the text document’s context menu). Linking to the audio document will generate a link at the current time. Linking to range/label markers will generate a link corresponding to their start/end time. ![](../../../assets/gifs/audio/audiolinks.gif){:.img} ",

When a user first opens Dash, the first view is an empty pannable freeform canvas, one of many views that dash supports. The freeform view is a pannable and zoomable freeform unbounded 2D canvas where the majority of dash's workflow takes place. It is surround by toolbars and panels which we will go over below. ## Menu Panel Each icon has an associated flyout panel with additional functionality. Flyouts can be toggled open by clicking on corresponding icons. ![](../assets/gifs/environment/menu-panel.gif){:.img} ### Access Permanently pinned on the left. Flyouts can be toggled open & closed by clicking on the specific icon, or by clicking on the grey drag handle. | Icon | Title | Description |:-------------|:------------------|:------| ![](../assets/icons/dashboards.png){:.icon} | **Dashboards** | A flyout panel that contains a list of the user’s active dashboards and documents. The user can right-click on the topmost “Dashboard” to invoke the right-click menu, then selecting “Create Dashboard”, in order to create a new dashboard. Each dashboard contains the collections that are within that workspace and the user can choose to expand those collections to view a list of all the items in that collection. The “On-screen Tab” section contains all your currently-opened tabs. Tabs you have closed will be moved to the “Off-screen Tab” section. | ![](../assets/icons/search.png){:.icon} | **Search** | Search for any documents within the currently selected Dashboard.

A particular layout of tabs is called a dashboard. A dashboard can consist of one or more tabs. A user can have multiple dashboards to support different workflows. For example, one to collect a photo album, and another to take notes during class. Although documents can be linked and moved between dashboards, they are primarily designed to operate seperately. When you first log into Dash you will be placed in Dashboard 1 which is clearly in the topbar. #### Renaming a Dashboard To rename a dashboard, open the dashboard panel on the left and side and select the dashboard whose title you want to edit. If you click again you will be able to edit the text. #### Creating and switching Dashboards You can create a new Dashboard by clicking the “New” button in the topbar. Whenever you create a new dashboard it will create a new untitled tab in the freeform view. You can easily switch Dashboards by using the dropdown at the top. ### What is a tab? We display dash documents in the window manager with tabs. A tab can contain any document in dash. In your dashboard, tabs are organised into `Off-screen tabs` and `On-screen tabs`. ### What is a tile? Tiles can contain multiple tabs, you can drag and drop a tab into a tile such that you have multiple tabs in the same way that a browser like Chrome has multiple tabs. ",

    "content": "# Getting Started {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} ## Import and Content Creation There are multiple ways that you can import into Dash. The essential ways are as follows: - **Drag and drop**: drag any of the accepted file types from your computer or a webpage and drop it into your dashboard. - **Import**: import using the import menu on the left hand side - **Begin typing `:`** to bring up the document menu, from which you can create a document. If you are in Stacking or Schema view, you can click on `+ New`, and type a colon to open the colon menu. ## Documents Everything in Dash is considered a document. Documents store data as arbitrary key-value pairs. ### Document Types Dash supports several document types, each with unique capabilities. The primary types are as follows: - **[Text](documents/text.md)**: rich (RTF) text documents that support various text and hypertext features - **[Webpages](documents/webpage.md)**: HTML webpages from external sites - **[PDFs](documents/pdf.md)**: PDF files created outside of Dash - **[Temporal Media](documents/tempMedia/temporal-media.md)**: audio and video files - **[Ink](featyres/ink.md)**: ink strokes drawn with the pen or polygon tool - **Images**: digital images from external sources ### Selecting Documents There are three ways to select a document in Dash. To select a single document, simply left-click or right-click the desired document to bring it into focus. You can select multiple documents via marquee or shift-click. To use the marquee tool, right-click on the canvas to invoke the marquee; then, drag the bounding area to include your desired documents. To use shift-click, hold down the shift key while left-clicking on multiple documents. ![](../assets/gifs/gettingstarted/groupselection.gif){:.img} To select text in PDFs and webpages (not text documents), click and drag to highlight the desired text. ### Editing Documents The following editing functions are universal to all document types: - **Document chrome**: floating set of tools to change document properties - Accessed via single selection (left or right click) - **Properties panel**: panel displaying document type-specific actions - Accessed via (A) the double arrows in the top right or (B) the single arrow on the right edge of the screen - **Right-click menu**: menu displaying actions on documents - Accessed by right-clicking anywhere on the target document or left-clicking the settings icon on each document All documents also have a context-sensitive toolbar. The toolbar contents vary depending on the document type. ### Transforming Documents There are four main ways to transform a document: move, resize, open in a new tab or tile, and close. - **Move** - **Selected documents**: click and drag on the title to move the document, then drop at the desired location. - **Unselected documents**: hover over the document to bring it into focus, then click/drag/drop to the desired location. - **Resize** - **Size**: click and drag the corner handles in the border chrome. - **Border radius**: click and drag the small circle in the bottom right corner of the border chrome. - **Open in a new tab or tile** - Click on the rightmost “open in a new tile” icon in the header chrome to open a full view of the document in a new tile (defaults to alias). - **Close** - **Selected documents**: click on the leftmost “x” icon in the header chrome to close the document. Alternatively, click on the trash icon under the “actions” subpanel of the properties panel to close the document. - **Unselected documents**: right-click anywhere in the document to bring up the right-click menu, then click “close”. ## Views Views represent various ways to visualize a collection. Users can toggle different views through the pull-down menu in the leftmost region of the context-sensitive toolbar. Alternatively, they can open a new view as an alias by right-clicking on the current collection and selecting the desired perspective. The default view is freeform. ### Freeform **Description**: unbounded 2D space in the form of a canvas **Good for**: - User-driven spatial organization and document layouts - Visualizing document relationships, e.g., neighborhoods/clusters of related materials, nesting, and linking - “Raw” document views to get a sense of individual layouts ### Schema **Description**: table view of documents. Each document is a row, and each column displays the contents (values) stored with the unique document key. Nested collections can be expanded in-line. The title, author, date last modified, text, and context columns are displayed by default, and users can manually add more columns with existing keys or user-defined keys. **Good for:** - Maintaining structured viewing and sorting of data - Manipulating documents via key-value pairs - Working with search functionality - Navigating Dash an an “Excel sheet” ### Tree **Description**: a hierarchal outline of documents. Each item is expandable into sub-items, and sub-items range from a sub-tree of documents stored inside the current document to a live preview of the current document. **Good for**: - Viewing hierarchical relationships between documents - Navigating Dash as a file directory - Manipulating document z-indices (overlay layer) ### Stacking **Description**: scrollable stacks of documents. All documents are placed in a single stack by default. If a key is specified, multiple stacks will show up side-by-side, each containing documents sharing the same value for that key. **Good for**: - Categorizing documents by specified keys while maintaining a live preview of each document - Navigating Dash as a “Trello Board” ### Masonry **Description**: 2D grid of tiles that avoids empty space. Documents automatically reflow and wrap as the aspect ratio is reszied. Documents can be categorized via unique keys, which displays each category in a separate grid. Multiple categories are vertically stacked. **Good for**: - Avoiding vertical or horizontal padding required by grid perspectives - Navigating Dash as a “Pinterest Board” ## Links and Anchors A link is a bidirectional reference from one document to another. The link itself is also a document, so we can add tags and key-value pairs to it. The same source selection (aka anchor) can link to multiple destinations, which range from an entire document to a portion of a document (eg. an annotation in a PDF, highlighted phrase in text, etc.) ### Creating links There are two ways to create links: drag and drop or linkboard. Drag and drop creates a 1:1 link between documents that both appear on the screen at a given time, whether in the same tab or in two different tiles. 1. Select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar. 2. Click and drag the link icon. Drop it onto the desired destination document. Once a document is created, two messages will appear: one confirming successful link creation, and another prompting users for an optional link label. Labels may be modified later thorugh the link menu. The document will then display a number displaying the number of links it contains. Linkboards function as a clipboard: they \"copy\" source documents to the linkboard until they are cleared or linked to another source. This is convenient for creating multiple links with the same source and/or creating links while maintaining another workflow. 1. Select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar. 2. Left-click the \"make link\" button. 1. A popup bar will display at the bottom of the screen with two options: one to toggle displaying or hiding optional link labels, and one to clear the current linkboard. 3. Complete the link by clicking the \"complete link\" button in the bottom toolbar of the target document. ![](../assets/gifs/gettingstarted/linking.gif){:.img} ### Editing links Once a link is created, a blue dot will appear in the document's bottom left corner. The number represents the number of links on the document. Clicking on the dot displays all links in a list; hovering over each list item shows several link editing options, as well as a preview of the document it links to. The link editing options are as follows: - Show/hide anchor: renders a trail visually representing the link and its anchors. Anchors are indicated as colored dots on the bottom right of the document; links are shown as a dotted line. - Show/hide link: toggles the dotted line created by the show/hide anchor tool above. - Move/freeze dot: toggles the user's ability to reposition anchor dots. - Edit link: opens a modal for editing link descriptions, relationships, and follow behavior. - Delete link: removes the selected link. ## Annotation and Markup Media documents (eg. PDFs, webpages, images, videos, audio) currently support user annotations and markups. There are four types of annotations: ### Text **Description**: in-line text annotations. **Access**: - Click anywhere on the media document, then start typing - On PDFs: highlight the desired PDF text, then use the floating toolbar to create an annotation. Alternatively, drag the highlighted text to an existing annotation. ![](../assets/gifs/gettingstarted/textannos.gif){:.img} ### Ink **Description**: embedded ink strokes. **Access**: - Draw anywhere on the media document. ### Marquee selection (collection) **Description**: an empty, semi-transparent collection that serves as an anchor for links as well as a “highlight” for a desired region. **Access**: - Perform a marquee selection on the desired region, then select \"Create a Collection\" on the floating toolbar. ![](../assets/gifs/gettingstarted/marqueeannos.gif){:.img} ### Highlight **Description**: highlights of PDF and website text portions. **Access**: - Select the desired portion of the text. Right-click the highlighted region and use the floating toolbar to edit the highlight. ### Pushpin **Description**: toggles the visibility of user annotations. **Access**: - By default, dragging an annotation outside of its parent document will leave a pushpin at the original location the annotation was created. ## Collaboration Dash documents can be shared with individuals, groups of individuals, or a combination of both. Users may assign four types of document access rights: **1. Admin**: users can add, remove, edit, and change others' access rights to the document. **2. Can Edit**: users can add, remove, and edit the contents of a document. However, they may not change others' access rights. **3. Can Augment**: users can annotate and add other documents, but they cannot edit or remove the document. **4. Not Shared**: users have no access and cannot add, edit, remove, or view the document. **To create a group**: 1. Click on the settings button on the top right in the menu and select the Modes submenu. Click on the Manage Groups Button. 2. Click on the Create Group button to open the group creation menu. 3. Enter a group name and add group members (or leave that field empty for an empty group). Click on Create to create the group. 4. Click on the blue *i* to view or edit group members. You can add or remove members or delete the group from this menu. ![](../assets/gifs/gettingstarted/sharing.gif){:.img} ",

    "content": "# Ink {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} Dash allows the user to draw various shapes and lines, each represented by an ink stroke. Each ink stroke is a document. Ink documents can be created using a simple pen tool or a polygon tool. Currently implemented polygons include: circles, rectangles, straight lines, and arrows. Once an ink document is created, its properties, such as stroke color, fill color, stroke width, and control points can further be modified under the Properties Panel. ## Creating Ink The ink tools can be found in the ink toolbar. Single-clicking on one of the tools will bring the user to ink mode only for the duration of that drawing action. Conversely, double-clicking will keep the user in ink mode until the button is clicked again. ## Formatting Ink When the user opens the Properties Panel while at least one ink document is selected, the \"appearance\" and \"transform\" subpanels become visible. Changes made in the panels will only be reflected in the documents selected. ### Appearance Panel - **Change Width:** Users can augment width using the input box or the range slider. - **Arrow Head/End:** Users can add or remove arrowheads or arrow ends by checking the corresponding box. - **Dashed Line:** Users can toggle between solid and dashed strokes by checking the corresponding box. - **Fill and Stroke Color:** Users can change the colors of the stroke and fill using the palette that appears when the user clicks on the currently selected colors. ### Transform Panel - **Editing Points:** Clicking on the \"edit points\" button in the transform subpanel or double-clicking the currently selected ink brings up multiple squares outlined in blue along the ink stroke. By dragging these control points and tangent handles, users can alter the Bézier curve. When one handle point is moved, its opposite handle point will rotate the same angle in the opposite direction, resulting in synchronous movement. To break handle tangency and allow independent movement of either handle point, the user can hold the 'Alt' or 'Option' key while dragging. Double-tapping a broken control point will snap the handles back to being parallel and re-enable synchronous movement. Control points can be deleted (pressing backspace with the point selected) or added (single clicking on the desired point on the stroke, indicated by the blue circle that appears on hover). - **Lock Ratio:** Users can click on the lock button to lock the dimension ratio so that they can change the width and the height of the document proportionally. - **Rotate:** Users can rotate ink documents 90 degrees by clicking on the rotate button. Alternatively, users can change the value inside the “∠:” input box. - **Height and Width:** Users can change the height and width of the ink documents by changing the values inside the “H:” and “W:” input boxes. - **X and Y:** Users can change the x coordinate and y coordinate of the ink documents by changing the values inside the “X:” and “Y:” input boxes.

    "doc": "Linking",
    "title": "Linking",
    "content": "# Linking {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} A link in Dash can be thought of as a bidirectional connection between two documents, or a reference to one document from another. It is also a document in itself, meaning that we can add tags and other key/value pairs. The same source selection (called an anchor, i.e., a persistent selection) can link to multiple destination anchors. In addition, source and destination anchors can both range from the entire document to a portion of a document (i.e., a phrase within a long text document, an annotation on a pdf, a selection on an image, etc). We now describe two different mechanisms for creating links; we begin by describing document to document links. More information on linking between selections within documents can be found here. ## Creating Links - \"Drag and Drop\" Method There are two methods of creating links. The first is “drag-and-drop”, which is a light-weight method good for creating a one-to-one link between documents that both appear on the screen at a given time, whether in the same tab or in two different tiles. 1. Select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar where three icons are present. 2. Click and drag the leftmost link icon (the “make link” button), then drop it onto the desired destination document. 3. After the link is created, two messages will appear on the screen: - The upper message notifies that a link was successfully created, and will disappear after two seconds. - The lower message displays an input box to enter an optional label for the link - it typically is an explanatory word or short phrase describing the link. Pressing enter on the keyboard or clicking the add button will add the label to the link, and clicking anywhere else outside of the message or clicking the dismiss button will cause the message to disappear. - If users do not enter a link label on creation or wish to modify the label after creation, it can be done through the link menu (described in the subsequent editing links section). - Once a link is created, if there are no existing links on the document a blue dot will appear on the bottom left corner of the document containing the number of links that exist on the document. This counter is incremented for each additional link created. More information on this dot and its functionality can be found here. ## Creating Links - \"Linkboard\" The second method for link creation is through the “linkboard,” which is convenient for creating many links with the same source and for creating links while maintaining another workflow. This functions as a clipboard (similar to copy and paste) for links in the sense that your source is always “copied” to the linkboard until you clear it or “copy” another source. 1. Same as the first method above, select the desired source document and navigate to its bottom toolbar where three icons are present. 2. Then, left-click on the make link button. This turns the document into a source document for links to be created from. The make link button will turn grey with a red outline, and the middle icon (the “end link” button) will be activated, indicated by a black background. 3. In addition, a popup bar will appear at the bottom of the screen, next to the shortcut buttons. This popup displays the current source document’s title and allows users to change certain linking preferences using the two grey buttons: 4. Complete the link by clicking on the complete link button in the bottom toolbar of the desired target document. Clicking this complete link button on any document that is not the source document will create a link between the source document and that document. Clicking on the complete link button on the source document will do nothing. 5. At any time (whether there is a source on the linkboard or not), clicking the start link button (the first button in the bottom buttons of the document) will make that document the source for links. If there was already a source on the linkboard, that source will be cleared and the selected document will become the new source. When there is a source on the link board, the user can go about their workflow normally. They can continue to select and interact with documents as they normally would and view and edit existing links as well. The only difference is that when there is a source on the link board, the stop link button is active and the user can no longer make “drag and drop” links from the source (because clicking that button again will clear the source), however the user can still make “drag and drop” links from any other document. ## Editing Links: - Once links are created on a document, a blue link dot appears in its bottom left corner containing the counter that shows the number of links on the document: - Clicking on the blue link dot will open a link menu that displays each link on the document in a list. Each link is shown with an icon representing the type of document that the link is to and the title of the document that is on the other end of the link: - Hovering over an item in this link menu displays several options for the link. First, hovering over the title produces a blue underline which indicates that the title is a hyperlink that can be clicked on to follow the link (more information here). Hovering over the title also shows a preview of the destination document: - Hovering over an item in the link menu also makes three buttons on that link visible: - The leftmost button is to toggle on/off the link as a dotted curved path between the two documents (link path). - Clicking on the rightmost button deletes the link. Deleting a link deletes it on both the source and destination documents. If a document contains only one link, and that link is deleted, the blue link dot at the bottom left corner will disappear, and will only reappear when another new link is created on that document. - The middle button is to edit the link’s properties. Clicking on the button to edit the link will invoke a link editor: - In this link editor, the user can edit the link label that they added on creation of the link (or add a link label if they chose to not add one). The label will be added to the link when the user clicks the set button or hits enter after typing in the label box. When the label is added, the set button will turn green for 2 seconds to indicate to the user that the label was added. When a link label has been added, it will be shown in the link menu, right underneath the title of the destination document: - The user can also set a link relationship or choose one of their existing link relationships. All the links in the same relationship have the same link path color. Link paths have weights corresponding to their relative importance (i.e. number of links contained in the relationship) - The user can also choose to modify the follow behavior of the link (a type of “view spec”). Following a link takes the user to the destination document. The link editor allows the user to select different follow behaviors from this dropdown menu: - The default option is to pan the screen to the destination document if both documents are in the same collection and otherwise opens it in a new tile on the right side of the screen. - Additionally, the user can click the arrow in the top right corner of the editor to display/hide more information about the link ## Additional Link Functionalities - **Linking selections within a document:** For text, pdf, webpage (linking with Hypothes.is), image, audio (linking with audio) documents, the user has the option to link a specific selection within a document (anchor) to another document: - **Text** In order to link a piece of text in a document, the user must select the text and then drag the link icon to the document that they want to link it to (shown below). As of 8/10/2020, the “linkboard” method (clicking the start link and complete link buttons) is not yet supported and using this method will link your entire text document to the destination. Once the text anchor is linked, it turns blue and will show a blue underline on hover. The user can click on the linked piece of text to preview the destination document and use the two buttons at the top right corner to delete and follow the link. (*external hyperlinks to websites outside of Dash will always show a blue underline so that they can be differentiated from internal links within Dash) - **Image/PDF/Web** In order to link a portion of an image, PDF, or webpage, the user must first create a selection on the document. This can be done by right clicking and dragging over the area that the user wants to select. Once the user has made this selection, they can treat the selection as a document and use its bottom buttons to create links normally (not shown in gif). - **Following Links:** In order to follow a link on a document, you must click on the title of the destination document in the link menu. Clicking on this and “following” the link will show you the destination document of this link, based on the specified following behavior (following behavior). - **Showing Links and Labels:** In the link menu, there is an option to visibly show the link. Clicking on this option will show a dotted path between the two documents that are linked. If there is a link label on this link, it will appear on the dotted path. The user can also move the link label around this path and position it where they want. ",

    "title": "Markup",
    "content": "# Markup {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} Users are able to markup all documents in Dash using text annotations, ink, highlighted selections, or embedding other documents on top. ## Marquee Selection Clicking and dragging within an image, webpage, PDF, or video will display a rectangular marquee selection with a small menu in the bottom right corner with three options: - **Highlight:** The highlighter icon will create a translucent overlay the size of the selection that can be transformed and linked just like any other document. The color of this highlight can be changed by first selecting a color from the dropdown next to the highlight button before selecting the highlighter icon. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/marqueehighlight.gif){:.img} - **Annotation:** The text bubble icon can be clicked and dragged to create an annotation note which links back to an anchor placed on the document where the selection was. Clicking this anchor created by the marquee selection by default follows the link. - In PDFs and webpages, the icon can be just clicked, no dragging required, which will create an annotation in the right sidebar menu which displays all annotations. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/marqueedragannotation.gif){:.img} - **Search and link:** The magnifying glass icon brings up a small menu that allows you to search for a document in your Dash workspace. Selecting a document from this menu will create a link to the chosen document and an anchor on the document containing the marquee selection similar to annotations. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/marqueesearchlink.gif){:.img} ## Embedding All types of documents can have all types of other documents embedded in them. This is simply done by dragging the document by the title bar and dropping it on top of another document. This can be reversed by dragging the title bar of the document out of the document in which it is embedded. When you remove an embedded document from a webpage, image, video, or PDF in which it was embedded, it will leave behind a pushpin on the containing document in that position that is now linked to the removed document. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/embed.gif){:.img} ## Text Highlighting Selecting text with the cursor in text, PDF, and website documents will display the same markup menu as the one described for marquee selection above. The only difference is that this will select the specific text as the link anchor or highlight instead of creating a large rectangular selection. Linked text in a text document will display similar to a website hyperlink and clicking the text will display a preview of the linked document. Clicking this will follow the link. Colored highlights can be deleted by right clicking on the highlight and selecting the trash can icon. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/intexthighlight.gif){:.img} ## Ink Ink can be used to markup documents by selecting the ink tools from the top menu bar and drawing directly on top of a document. This will create ink strokes that are embedded similar to how other documents are embedded. And just as described above, they can be removed by selecting them and dragging them out of the containing document. Note: as with other embedded documents, ink strokes may resize when removing them from the containing document. ![](../../assets/gifs/markup/inkembed.gif){:.img} ",

With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.\" - As We May Think, Vannevar Bush (1945) Presentation Trails allow the user to navigate through selected documents with a predefined path and style in two different ways: - **List**: Navigate using pan and zoom through a predefined order of the documents in any in the Dash database and focus on the document. - **3D Carousel**: 3D Carousel view of the documents added to the presentation trail. With presentation trails you can easily go from authoring mode, to presentation mode - and turn whatever you are working on into a smooth presentation. Presentation Trails work best when all of the documents are contained within Freeform collections, as it makes use of pan and zoom to navigate between documents. ## Creating a Presentation Trail There are three ways of bring up a new Presentation Trail document, they are as follows: - **Tools menu:** Presentation trail button which can be opened on the right hand side of your workspace on click. - **Pin any document to presentation:** To pin or any document from the active Presentation Trail use the document decorations ‘Pin to Presentation’ button. If the Presentation Trail is not already open, pinning a document will open the Presentation - Trail document on the right hand side of your workspace. - **Pres. Trails Sidebar**: Right click anywhere on the presentation trails sidebar menu, and select the option to “Create New Presentation” To access a Presentation Trail that has already been created use the PRES. TRAILS sidebar in the left hand toolbar, or use Search. ## Objects & Actions ### Adding documents to a presentation trail #### Regular pin: To pin any document to the presentation trail simply select a document and use the ‘Pin’ button in the document decorations to add it to the presentation trail. If the user has not yet created a presentation trail, then this button will also create a new presentation trail and add that specific document as the first slide in the trail. #### Pin with view: Pinning with view pins the document with the specific pan and zoom that you have currently set it to. The ‘Pin with View’ icon is the same as the regular pin icon, but the “V” behind the pin shows that it is a view. You can pin with view in two ways: - Chroma - Pin with current view - Marquee menu - pin with selection drag ### Slides Slides are used to visually represent the path that the trail would follow. They can be rearranged, retitled, and expanded to show a preview of what is in the slide. Selected slides are indicated by the blue outline and the light blue background, on each slide the user can find: - Slide title: in bold on the far left hand side of the slide - M: The duration of the movement to the slide - D: The duration for which the slide will remain in focus for Auto-Present - Slide specific expand and minimise options - The option to remove the slide from the presentation (Note: does not remove slide from the collection or database, only from the presentation). ##### Transitions **Movement:** Specify the type of movement from the following options, as well as the amount of time that the movement from one document to the next will take: Pan and zoom: Center the document in the containing collection and zoom in on it so it takes 75% of the height or width of the screen depending on what fits. Pan: Center the document maintaining the current scale of the containing collection Jump Switch: Switch to the zoomed in document with no transition time None: Nothing happens when this slide is the active one in the trail. **Visibility & Duration** - ide before: When this toggle is on the document will appear hidden before it is presented in the presentation trail - Hide after: When this option is toggled on after the slide is presented it will not appear in the presentation trail. - Lightbox: Open the document in Lightbox view, instead of navigating to it within the collection. This can be useful for navigating Websites/PDF etc. - Slide duration: Choose the amount of time that the slide will remain in focus when in Auto-present mode. **Effects** Choose to have an effect on the entrance of the selected document. The possible effects include: Fade In, Flip, Rotate, Bounce, and lastly Roll. ",
