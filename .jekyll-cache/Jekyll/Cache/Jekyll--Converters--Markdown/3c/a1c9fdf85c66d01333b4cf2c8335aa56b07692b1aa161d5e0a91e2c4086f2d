<h3 id="what-is-a-dashboard">What is a Dashboard?</h3>
<p>A particular layout of tabs is called a dashboard.  A dashboard can consist of one or more tabs. A user can have multiple dashboards to support different workflows. For example, one to collect a photo album, and another to take notes during class. Although documents can be linked and moved between dashboards, they are primarily designed to operate seperately. When you first log into Dash you will be placed in Dashboard 1 which is clearly in the topbar.</p>
