<h2 id="description">Description:</h2>
<p>Displays a set of documents in one or more scrollable stacks. By default, all documents are placed in a single stack. If a key is specified, multiple stacks will show up side-by-side, each containing documents sharing the same value for that key. Additionally, each value is displayed as an editable text field with a colored background at the top of the stack.</p>

<p>Categorizing documents by specified keys while maintaining a live preview of each document
Navigating Dash as a “Trello Board”</p>

<h2 id="objects--actions">Objects &amp; actions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Categorizing documents by a specified key: when a key is specified via typing in the “Group by” input box besides the perspectives pulldown, the default single stack transforms and displays multiple stacks side-by-side, each containing documents sharing the same value for that key.</li>
  <li>Updating the value of a specified key
    <ul>
      <li>For a single document: click and drag the desired document, then drop it into the target stack to update its value</li>
      <li>For a stack: click on the title (value) at the top of the stack to edit or delete the value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reposition documents within a stack: click and drag the desired document, then drop it into the target location within the stack to reposition it vertically. This will not affect its metadata.</li>
  <li>Navigating Dash as a “Trello Board” - when combined with a document view showing only a document’s title, this essentially becomes a Trello board</li>
</ul>
