<p>Presentation Trails allow the user to navigate through selected documents with a predefined path and style in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List</strong>: Navigate using pan and zoom through a predefined order of the documents in any in the Dash database and focus on the document.</li>
  <li><strong>3D Carousel</strong>: 3D Carousel view of the documents added to the presentation trail.</li>
</ul>

<p>With presentation trails you can easily go from authoring mode, to presentation mode - and turn whatever you are working on into a smooth presentation. Presentation Trails work best when all of the documents are contained within Freeform collections, as it makes use of pan and zoom to navigate between documents.</p>

<h4 id="regular-pin">Regular pin:</h4>
<p>To pin any document to the presentation trail simply select a document and use the â€˜Pinâ€™ button in the document decorations to add it to the presentation trail. If the user has not yet created a presentation trail, then this button will also create a new presentation trail and add that specific document as the first slide in the trail.</p>

<h4 id="pin-with-view">Pin with view:</h4>
<p>Pinning with view pins the document with the specific pan and zoom that you have currently set it to. The â€˜Pin with Viewâ€™ icon is the same as the regular pin icon, but the â€œVâ€ behind the pin shows that it is a view. You can pin with view in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chroma - Pin with current view</li>
  <li>Marquee menu - pin with selection drag</li>
</ul>
